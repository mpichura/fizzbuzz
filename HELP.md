#The problem
This is a simple variation on the well known http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/ kata exercise.

Please write code delivering the requirements of the steps that follow and execute them one by one - do one at a time please, and don’t be tempted to read the following one :).

The code should be developed using TDD so test first, be as simple as possible and self explanatory and automatable with a build file of your choice.

##Step 1
Write code that produces the following output for each number in a contiguous range of integers:

1.	the number itself
2.	‘fizz’ for numbers that are multiples of 3
3.	‘buzz’ for numbers that are multiples of 5
4.	‘fizzbuzz’ for numbers that are multiples of 15

Being careful to avoid trailing spaces.

e.g. running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:

1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

Init a local git repository and create a commit with the solution.

##Step 2
Please enhance your existing FizzBuzz solution to perform the following:

If the number contains a three you must output the text ‘alfresco’, any other rule is skipped.

e.g. running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:

1 2 alfresco 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz alfresco 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

Create a branch for the alfresco variation and then a commit with the solution.

##Step 3
Produce a report at the end of the output showing how many times the following were printed:

fizz
buzz
fizzbuzz
alfresco
an integer
e.g. Running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:

1 2 alfresco 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz alfresco 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
fizz: 4 buzz: 3 fizzbuzz: 1 alfresco: 2 integer: 10

(Integer is 10 because there were 10 numbers in the output that were not altered).
##Step 4
Wrap this in a RESTful API for a fizzbuzz integer range resource using Spring Boot or any other technology you are familiar with, and create an integration test for a successful run and for an invalid input, for example a string rather than a number.

###Test using
curl "http://localhost:8080/fizzbuzz-resource?startFrom=1&endAt=20"
### or run
FizzBuzzIntegrationTest class

##Step 5

Create a docker image with your REST API server and launch a container, then execute the same integration test as in Step 4.
###NOT IMPLEMENTED IN MVN BUILD
##Step 6

Full Stack bonus! Create a simple JavaScript user interface providing a form for the input number calling the REST API and printing the result without page reload.
